<p><strong>I&#8217;ll leave you with some food for thought‚Ä¶</strong></p>



<p>Systems thinking. Evaluate choices through these principles:</p>



<p>Leverage (a machine‚Ä¶ engine): from high/low input to high/low output<br>Duration: half-life/decay-rate<br>Fallibility: second-order consequences/side-effects (impurity)/leakage<br>Compounding: presence of feedback/byproduct, preferably positive, affecting scale and reusability<br>High-return samples:</p>



<p>Capital/asset allocation<br>Incentive structures<br>Restructuring<br>Long-term partnerships<br>Radical innovation<br>Low-return samples:</p>



<p>Non-consistent, micro-managed, spontaneous actions<br>Daily meals<br>Wardrobe choices</p>



<p>P.S. Did I mention my fondness for coding Redux.js apps? And that I also love Sublime Text! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/270c-1f3fb.png" alt="‚úåüèª" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
